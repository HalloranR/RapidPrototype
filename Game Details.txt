Theme of the Game: One Button

Our game aproaches the theme by taking it literally. 
The player has one button (left mouse) to use in order to defeat the oncoming enemies
I played around with having different states your tile deletions can be so I added the long deletion

Controls
	- Use mouse to look around
	- No movement use the ray to aim the camera at tiles
	- by pressing left mouse button you can delete a tile
	- The first tile you delete will be gone for 8 seconds
	- after 8 seconds the tile will respawn and the next tile you delete will last 8
	- all other tiles will be deleted for 2 second and return after
	- the player can not delete the tile they stand on
	- once an enemy reaches the player's tile you lose 1 life, max 3
